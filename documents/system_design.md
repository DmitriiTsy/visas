# ALMA Immigration App - System Design Doc

Hey there! Let me walk you through how I built this app and why I made certain choices.

## Overall Architecture

I'm using what's called a "Single Page Application" (SPA) architecture, which means the app feels super smooth - no annoying page reloads! Here's the main tech I'm using:

- **Next.js 14** (App Router): This is my main framework. I picked it cause:
  - It's crazy fast (check out [Next.js Performance](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/analytics))
  - Has built-in SEO stuff
  - Server-side rendering when I need it
  - Super easy routing
- **React 18**: For building my UI. I'm using all the cool new stuff like:
  - Hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo)
  - Server Components
  - [React Best Practices](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react)

## State Management

I've got two types of state management going on:

1. **Redux** for global stuff:

   - Managing leads data
   - Form submissions
   - Basically anything that needs to be accessed everywhere
   - [Redux Style Guide](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide)

2. **Local State** (useState):
   - Form inputs
   - UI states (like if a modal is open)
   - Anything that's just for one component

## Data Flow

Here's how data moves around in my app:

```
User Input -> Redux Action -> Redux Store -> Components -> LocalStorage
```

I'm using LocalStorage to keep the leads data around even if you refresh the page (kinda like a mini-database but in the browser).

## Components Structure

I've organized my components like this:

```
src/
├── components/         # Reusable stuff
│   ├── LeadForm       # The big form on landing page
│   ├── FileUpload     # Handles file uploads
│   └── Navigation     # The nav bar
├── app/               # Pages
│   ├── page.tsx       # Landing page
│   └── dashboard/     # Admin dashboard
└── store/             # Redux stuff
```

## Authentication

I've kept it simple (but secure enough for demo):

- Basic username/password auth
- Protected routes (can't access dashboard without logging in)
- Auth state persists in localStorage

## UI/UX Decisions

1. **Form Design**:

   - Multi-step form for better user experience
   - Real-time validation
   - Clear error messages
   - [Form Design Best Practices](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/)

2. **Dashboard**:
   - Clean table layout
   - Sortable columns
   - Search functionality
   - Pagination (8 items per page)
   - Status management with visual feedback
   - [Dashboard Design Guidelines](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/02/designing-dashboard-analytics-solutions/)

## Styling Approach

I'm using Emotion (CSS-in-JS) because:

- No CSS conflicts (everything's scoped)
- Dynamic styles based on props
- Better performance than traditional CSS
- [Emotion Best Practices](https://emotion.sh/docs/best-practices)

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting**:

   - Each page loads only what it needs
   - Dynamic imports for heavy components

2. **Memoization**:

   - Using useMemo for expensive calculations
   - React.memo for pure components
   - [React Performance](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit)

3. **State Updates**:
   - Batch updates where possible
   - Debounced search input
   - Optimized sorting algorithms

## Future Improvements

Some stuff I could add:

1. **Backend Integration**:

   - Real API endpoints
   - Proper database (probably PostgreSQL but thinking about Supabase as a quick easy solution and really FAST)
   - File storage solution (like AWS S3/ DO Spaces & droplets)

2. **Authentication**:

   - OAuth integration
   - Role-based access control
   - JWT tokens

3. **Features**:
   - Email notifications
   - Document generation
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Bulk actions

## Known Limitations

Just so you know:

- Data is stored in localStorage (gets cleared if you clear browser data)
- File uploads are temporary (files don't persist)
- Basic auth system (not production-ready)
- Limited to client-side operations

## Development Practices

I followed these principles:

- Component reusability
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Consistent code style (ESLint + Prettier)
- Responsive design
- Progressive enhancement

## Testing Strategy

Currently implemented:

- TypeScript for type checking
- ESLint for code quality

Could be added:

- Jest for unit tests
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Cypress for E2E tests

## Deployment

The app can be deployed to:

- Vercel (recommended for Next.js)
- Netlify
- Any static hosting

Just run `npm run build` and you're good to go!

Remember: This is a demo app, so I've made some tradeoffs for simplicity. In a real production app, you'd want to add more security, proper backend integration, and thorough testing.
