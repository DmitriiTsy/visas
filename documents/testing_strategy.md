# Testing Strategy Documentation

## Overview

I've implemented a focused set of unit tests targeting the most critical parts of the application. Instead of aiming for complete coverage, I chose to test the components and functionality that are most likely to cause issues or are essential for the application's core functionality.

## Test Cases and Rationale

### 1. Redux State Management (leadsSlice.test.ts)

I focused on testing the Redux store because it's the central source of truth for our application data.

**Key Test Cases:**

- Adding a new lead
- Updating lead status
- Setting multiple leads

**Why These Tests:**

- These operations directly affect the application's core data
- They verify that the Redux state updates correctly
- They ensure data persistence works as expected

### 2. SearchBar Component (SearchBar.test.tsx)

The search functionality is a critical user interaction point that needs to work reliably.

**Key Test Cases:**

- Input value updates
- Debounced search callback

**Why These Tests:**

- Verifies that user input is captured correctly
- Ensures the debounce functionality works (prevents excessive API calls)
- Confirms the search callback is triggered with correct values

### 3. LeadForm Validation (LeadForm.test.tsx)

Form validation is crucial for data integrity and user experience.

**Key Test Cases:**

- Email validation
- Required field validation

**Why These Tests:**

- Prevents invalid data from being submitted
- Ensures users get appropriate feedback on errors
- Validates the most common form interactions

## Testing Tools Used

- Jest: Testing framework
- React Testing Library: Component testing
- Redux Test Utils: Store testing

## What I Didn't Test (and Why)

1. **UI Styling**: Visual aspects are better covered by visual regression testing or manual review
2. **Complex Interactions**: End-to-end tests would be more appropriate
3. **Edge Cases**: Focused on common use cases for maintainability

## Future Test Improvements

If needed, I could expand the test suite to include:

1. Integration tests for form submission flow
2. Error boundary testing
3. Route protection testing
4. Performance testing for search functionality

Remember: These tests cover the most critical paths while keeping the test suite maintainable and meaningful.
